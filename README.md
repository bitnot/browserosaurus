Browserosaurus is an open-source (MIT license), Electron-based browser prompter for macOS. It works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links in non-browser apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where it’ll present you with a menu of all your installed browsers. You may now decide which browser you’d like to continue opening the link with.
